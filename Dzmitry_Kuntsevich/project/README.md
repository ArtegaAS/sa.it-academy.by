## Pipeline. High Level Design
![project-scheme](https://github.com/2Qic1/04.Github-actions/blob/master/photo/project.jpg)

All infrastructure code is stored in a Git repository, GitHub acts as a single source of truth,
all configurations are stored here.

GitHub Action is implemented as follows: when pushing changes to the repository,
the repository files are checked for keys (private and public),
after which a notification is sent to Discord that someone made a push and about the keys found.

The heart of the system is ArgoCD, which implements the GitOps approach:
1) Constantly monitors the repository for changes
2) Automatically synchronizes the cluster state with the configuration in Git
3) Provides a UI for monitoring the status of applications.

The cluster deploys:
1) MariaDB as a Stateful Service with Persistent Volumes (separate storage on the disk)
2) WordPress as a Stateless Application (Simply put: This is a website engine that does not store data itself, but only takes it from the database)
3) an Ingress controller is implemented for incoming traffic

   Endpoint access for users. Access to the WordPress application is configured via Ingress.
